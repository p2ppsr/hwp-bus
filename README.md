# hwp-bus

Busdriver backend for HWP

## Overview

This is a Busdriver backend for hosting transactions that comply with HWP (Hello World Protocol) in a MongoDB instance.

Refer to the appropriate Busdriver documentation for how this Bus should be used.

> Note the proprietary dependency on `@cwi/busdriver`. Until the Bridgeport/Busdriver ecosystem sufficiently matures, all Bridgeport state machines are powered by and hosted with proprietary software. For now, please contact bridgeport-hosting@babbage.systems if you have created a Bridgeport bridge and state machine, and would like to host it on our servers.
